# Storyboard.jsx
**It can transform your artboards into a Storyboard!!**

I realized how useful the artboard function is when I started to use illustrator for UI designs. I came up with this idea that transforms the artboards into a Storyboard. I thought it will become useful. 

I hope you will be satisfied with it.

## Installation
Please put this script file into the script folder of illustrator.

For example in CC 2014.
```
Windows: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe lllustratorCC2014\Presets\[language]\Scripts\
```
```
Mac OS: /Applications/Adobe lllustrator CC 2014/Presets/[language]/Scripts/
```

## Usage

1. Add specialized tags to the name of your artboards.
2. Execute this script.

Your artboards will be arranged, and will be similar to a storyboard. Each screen comes with allows.

The specialized tags are quite simple!! The tags consist of the sequence numbers combined hyphens together as below.
