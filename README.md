# Storyboard.jsx
**It can transform your artboards into a Storyboard!!**

I realized how useful the artboard function is when I started to use illustrator for UI designs. I became able to integrate multiple screens into an AI file.

I had to make and manage multiple files for an application when I used Photoshop. It was horroble to modify many things. In illustrator, however, I can see all screens in a AI file and modify such a big change quicker than before.

I came up with this idea that transforms the artboards into a Storyboard. I thought it will be useful for UI designers.

I hope you will be satisfied with it.

## Installation
Please put this script file into the script folder of illustrator.

For example in CC 2014.
```
Windows: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe lllustratorCC2014\Presets\[language]\Scripts\
```
```
Mac OS: /Applications/Adobe lllustrator CC 2014/Presets/[language]/Scripts/
```

## Usage

1. Add specialized tags to the name of your artboards.
2. Execute this script.

Your artboards will be arranged, and will be similar to a storyboard. Each screen comes with arrows indicating the next screens.

**After**

The specialized tags are quite simple!! The tags consist of the sequence numbers combined hyphens together as below.
